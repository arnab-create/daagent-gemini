Okay, I understand you're looking for the customers with the highest transaction volume. To clarify, by "transaction volume" do you mean:

1.  **Total number of transactions:** The customers who have made the most transactions regardless of the amount of each transaction?
2.  **Total amount of transactions:** The customers whose transactions add up to the highest dollar amount (sum of all transaction values)?

Please specify which of these you mean, and I'll provide the appropriate query to retrieve that information. Depending on the size of the data set, I may also suggest some optimizations for better performance.
